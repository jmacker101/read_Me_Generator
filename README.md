## Description: What was your motivation? if i could make a personalized readme that caters to what i want and make it interchangeable i have no problem with that helps me out better with future project and my own projects that i want to do later.

- Why did you build this readme? i built this for me and no one else it might be apart of my modules but i reconize that even this part where you can make you own readme file is valuable. 


- What problem does it solve? by being able to make a readme not from scratch but by one that i choose to make that i feel is easier for me help me keep on track with what i have planned. plus i can always make it just like how we were taught to comment  everything we do to help us out. i feel that this is just like that and will help keep me organize with wether it is a project, moudle or just a regular asssignment. 

- What did you learn? i learned by creating this readme it has helped me to make more in the future for my own benifit  and when other people read it hopefully they also can see and read the clearity it has for me as well.

- What makes your project stand out? (if this makes my life easier in making) this is taught  by our teacher and helped even more by our TA's to better help us as future developers/programmers if it stands out then so be it if it doesn't then oh well as long as other people can read it with clearity  and precision then i am fine with that.
